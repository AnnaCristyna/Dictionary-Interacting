The concept of this application is to show the universe in which the searched word is.

Legend:  
Each circles represent a word
- <span style="color:green">green</span> = adjective;
- <span style="color:purple">purple</span> = adverb;
- <span style="color:brown">brown</span> = verb;
- <span style="color:pink">pink</span> = noun;
- <span style="color:steelblue">steelblue</span> = others;

And the links:
- <span style="color:red">red</span>  = antonym;
- <span style="color:green">green</span>  = synonym;

There is still much to achieve!
