GitHub Pages: https://annacristyna.github.io/Dictionary-Interacting/

The concept of this application is to show the universe in which the searched word is.

Legend:  
Each circles represent a word
- green = adjective;
- purple = adverb;
- brown= verb;
- pink = noun;
- others = purple;

And the links:
- red = antonym;
- green = synonym;


There is still much to achieve!
